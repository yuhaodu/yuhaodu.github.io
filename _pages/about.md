Hi, I'm Yuhao, a PhD candidate at CompBias Lab at [University at Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html). I'm very blessed to be advised by [Kenny Joseph](https://kennyjoseph.github.io/). Boardly speaking, my research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to help tackle some challenging social problems. Currently, I'm working on building a system based on machine learning algorithms to help social workers distribute service to the youth in the foster care system.
